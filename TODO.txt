List of things that could be worked on:

1. Professions

2. Add Requirements for GEMs as well.

4. Allow users to edit charcter description.

5. Show character description.

6. Char SPECS.
  - save spec, and talent tree view for other users
  - add arrows for the talents that are prequisites
  - add all other talents
  - figure out links ?
  - *Make a fancy box which displays the talent info
  - **Change format of talents into: 1: {name: 'Infusion of Light', ...}
    - will make thing easier for later...
    - can also change talent pic names as well so can have a general format
    - can also have a single page instead of multiple.

7. DO GLYPHS!

Ideas:
