List of things that could be worked on:

1.  Work on the 'rel' attribute for equipping.
  - NOTE: IDs are dif for warmane and gems.json
  - orange/green = 36592, red = 36593 - don't know rel (can leave this till last)

2. Update stats when equipping a gem.

3. Implement the unequipping function for gems.

4.  Either change error/success messages to alerts or at least add fade
    animation to it.

5. Add an enchant tab.
