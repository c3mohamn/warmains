List of things that could be worked on:

1. Professions

2. Add Requirements for GEMs as well.

4. Allow users to edit charcter description.

5. Show character description.

6. Char SPECS.
  - save spec, and talent tree view for other users
  - add arrows for the talents that are prequisites
  - add all other talents
  - figure out links ?
  - can do glyphs by making them provide ID, then just add to href

Ideas:

- GS
- upload warmane armory character?
- buffs with UI similiar to Wow, mainly just raid buffs
  - flasks as well
  - potions as well
