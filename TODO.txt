List of things that could be worked on:


Urgent: Finish up IconPath's and Ids of Enchants.

1. Work on character page.

2. Enchants:
 - Multipliers
 - IDs
 - Make icon regular scroll icon with tooltip based on ID.

3. Socket Bonus

4. Professions

5. Try ng-show/hide on select options (onehand/twohand) enchants tab

6. Add Requirements for GEMs as well.


Ideas:

  - flasks as well
  - potions as well
