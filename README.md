# warmains
First Iteration of Wow character planner website.

# About
A couple years ago, a website called Chardev had closed down, and I was in search of a new Character Development website for World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King.

I could not find one.

After I took my first Web development course, I decided to make my own.

Having very little knowledge in making, deploying and maintaining a website, I begun this journey. And that was how Warmains was born.

I consider this Repo my first iteration. It is built using NodeJs / MongoDb / AngularJs / Bootstrap / JQuery (I know don't judge me).

Somehow, it helped my get my internship with a start up called Reportin (now Source).

There, I learned and am learning quite a bit. 

So, I decided to recreate my personal website, incorporating things that I learned. The repo for that is in Bitbucket, most likely private since I may actually deploy it.
The website is http://warmain.herokuapp.com/#/home (no s in warmains).

# Summary

Stopped commiting to this Repo because I recreated it.

New website:
